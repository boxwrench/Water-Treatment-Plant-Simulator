## Current Position
- **Phase**: 6: Vivid Realism & 100 MGD Scaling
- **Task**: Fully Implemented
- **Status**: ✅ Phase 6 Complete - All modules refactored to Vivid SCADA standard.

## Accomplishments
- [x] Evaluated prototype modules against Grade 3 operator requirements.
- [x] Researched 100 MGD plant design parameters (14 trains, 100ft clarifiers, etc.).
- [x] Identified advanced p5.js/Matter.js patterns for "Vivid Realism" (Floc engine, perlin water surfaces).
- [x] Implemented "Vivid Edition" (SCADA UI + 100 MGD Physics) for all 5 modules.
- [x] Successfully integrated Glassmorphism and High-Performance HMI (HPHMI) across the suite.

## Next Steps
1. Final User Verification and Classroom Deployment.
2. Optional: Add a "Master Dashboard" for total plant overview.

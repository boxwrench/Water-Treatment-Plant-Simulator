// WTP Operator Simulator - main.js
// Phase 1: Foundation & Core Systems

// This is the main entry point for our game's logic.
// For now, it will be kept simple as we build the foundation.

// --- GAME STATE ---
// A central object to hold all dynamic information about the game.
const gameState = {
    shiftTime: 8, // Hours remaining
    score: 0,
    currentView: 'control-room', // Which screen is active
    alarms: [
        // This will be populated when a new shift starts.
        // Example: { id: 'highHeadloss', title: 'High Headloss on Filter', solved: false }
    ],
    // More state properties will be added as we build the game.
};

// --- INITIALIZATION FUNCTION ---
// This function will set up the game when the page loads.
function initializeGame() {
    console.log("Welcome to the WTP Operator Simulator!");
    
    // For now, we'll just log to the console.
    // In Milestone 1.3, this function will set up the Control Room view.
}


// --- RUN THE GAME ---
// This line waits for the entire HTML page to load before running our initialization code.
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initializeGame);

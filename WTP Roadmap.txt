WTP Operator Simulator
1. Project Vision
The WTP Operator Simulator is an interactive training tool for water treatment professionals, built as a web-based game with a 16-bit SNES-style aesthetic. The goal is to create a learning experience that is both educational and enjoyable.

The core gameplay loop revolves around a "Hub and Spokes" model, where the player navigates from a central Control Room to tackle a series of randomized Problem Scenarios or experiment in hands-on Simulator Labs.

2. Core Features
Control Room Hub
A central dashboard where players begin their "shift," view active alarms, and access other game modes.

Problem Scenarios
A series of 5 realistic troubleshooting scenarios. Each scenario has 5 possible root causes that are randomly selected, ensuring high replayability. The problems include:

High Headloss on a Filter

Low Chlorine in the Clearwell

Low Total Chlorine in the Treated Water Reservoir

Short Filter Run Times

High Settled Water Turbidity

Simulator Labs
Interactive sandbox environments for hands-on learning of system mechanics, including:

Applied Channel Level Control

Chemical Feed Pump Dosing

Chloramination Ratio Model

Digital SOP Manual
An in-game reference guide that players can consult for procedural help and learning reinforcement.

3. How to Run

4. Development Status
This project is currently in Phase 1: Foundation & Core Systems.

The immediate goal is to build the main Control Room hub and the core game engine for navigating between views. See the full Project Map for more details.
